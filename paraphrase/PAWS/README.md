This corpus contains pairs generated from Wikipedia pages, and can be downloaded here:

- [`PAWS-Wiki Labeled (Final)`](https://github.com/Wikidepia/indonesia_dataset/tree/master/paraphrase/PAWS/data/final): containing pairs that are generated from both word swapping and back translation methods. All pairs have human judgements on both paraphrasing and fluency and they are split into Train/Dev/Test sections.
