# Stanford Question Answering Dataset

Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

**NEW** : Properly aligned SQuAD now added! Thanks to [TranslateAlignRetrieve](https://github.com/ccasimiro88/TranslateAlignRetrieve).

This dataset translated from English to Indonesia with Google Translate, and only aligned by searching from beginning of the context.

If you need to use `run_qa.py` from Huggingace, you need to run `process_hf.py` script to match Huggingface script.
