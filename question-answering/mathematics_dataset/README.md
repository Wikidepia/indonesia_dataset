# Mathematics Dataset

This dataset contains mathematical question and answer pairs, from a range of question types at roughly school-level difficulty. This is designed to test the mathematical learning and algebraic reasoning skills of learning models.

This set only contains 1000 questions and answer pairs each module. Generated using this [repo](https://github.com/Wikidepia/mathematics_dataset_id).
